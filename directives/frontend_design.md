This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Geometric Foundation (Antigravity Mode)**:
    - **Border Radius**: Strictly **0px** for all interactive elements (buttons, inputs, cards). Perfectly squared and sharp edges only.
    - **Buttons**:
        - **Primary**: Solid rectangular shape, deep black background (`#000000`), bold white text, Uppercase. No shadows, no rounding.
        - **Secondary/Ghost**: Transparent background, thin **1px black border**. Strictly rectangular.
    - **Search Bar**: Rectangular container with thin 1px borders. Icons must be minimalist line-art with a **1.5px stroke width**.
- **Typography & Hierarchy**:
    - **Headlines**: Use a bold, geometric **Sans-Serif**. Font-weight: **800**. Letter-spacing: **-0.04em** for a compact, premium "magazine" look.
    - **Contrast**: Extreme contrast between massive headlines and small, minimalist metadata.
    - **Negative Space**: Maintain large margins and padding to create an "airy" and "floating" (Antigravity) feel.
- **Motion & Effects**:
    - **Hero Parallax**: Implement a **"Smooth Vertical Parallax"** on hero images (moves at a different speed than content).
    - **Transitions**: Images should fade into a clean white background using a **linear CSS mask** or gradient at the bottom.

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes, or rounded corners when this geometric mode is active.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.
